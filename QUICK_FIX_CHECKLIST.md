# Quick Fix Checklist ✅

## 1. Run SQL Script (CRITICAL - Do This First!)

Open Supabase SQL Editor and run the entire content of `fix_login_logs_table.sql`

This will:
- ✅ Add `user_id` column to `login_logs` table
- ✅ Link existing logs to user profiles
- ✅ Create RLS policies for viewing and inserting logs

**Expected Output:**
```
NOTICE:  user_id column added to login_logs table
NOTICE:  Existing login logs updated with user_id where possible
```

## If Something Doesn't Work

### Login Logs Empty?
→ Did you run the SQL script? That's the critical step!

### Category Still Text Input?
→ Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + R)

### Can't Edit Books?
→ Look for pencil icon (🖊️) in last column of book table
