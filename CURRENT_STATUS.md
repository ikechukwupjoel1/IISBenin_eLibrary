# Current Status & Next Steps

## ✅ **Completed Fixes**
- **Librarian duplicate key error**: Fixed - Edge Function now checks for existing profiles
- **Student/Staff creation**: Working - Records are being inserted into database
- **Edge Function**: Updated to use direct inserts instead of RPC functions

## 🔍 **Issues to Test**

### 1. Student Login Test
**Student Record Created:**
```json
{
  "id": "8f1574b6-0496-4cd9-ae88-f1defd674b22",
  "name": "Bill",
  "email": "bill@gmail.com",
  "enrollment_id": "STU85043294",
  "grade_level": "Grade 10"
}
```

**Test Steps:**
1. Go to the login page
2. Select "Student" tab
3. Enter enrollment ID: `STU85043294`
4. Enter the password that was generated during creation
5. Click "Sign in as Student"

**Expected Result:** Should login successfully and redirect to student dashboard

**If it fails:**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Run the debug script:
```javascript
// Copy contents of debug-student-login.js
// Replace password with actual password
```

### 2. Staff Count Display Test
**Test Steps:**
1. Login as librarian
2. Go to Staff Management page
3. Create a new staff member
4. Check if the staff appears in the table immediately after creation
5. Check browser console for "Loading staff..." and "Staff created successfully" messages

**If staff doesn't appear:**
- Run debug script:
```javascript
// Copy contents of debug-staff-count.js
```

### 3. "Missing Email or Phone" Error
This error appeared during testing. It might be:
- Database constraint requiring contact info
- Supabase validation
- Unrelated to login (might be from a different operation)

**Investigation needed:** Check if this error occurs during login or during creation

## 🛠️ **Debug Scripts Available**
- `debug-student-login.js` - Test student authentication flow
- `debug-staff-count.js` - Check staff data consistency
- `quick-student-login-test.js` - Quick login test with known credentials
- `verify-student-creation.js` - Verify student records exist
- `verify-staff-creation.js` - Verify staff records exist

## 📋 **Next Actions**
1. **Test student login** with the known enrollment ID `STU85043294`
2. **Test staff creation** and verify it appears in the table
3. **Investigate "missing email or phone"** error source
4. **Remove debug logs** once issues are resolved

## 🔧 **Files Modified**
- `supabase/functions/create-user-account/index.ts` - Added existing profile check
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added authentication debugging
- `src/components/StaffManagement.tsx` - Added staff loading debugging

**Priority:** Test the student login first, then investigate the staff count issue.
