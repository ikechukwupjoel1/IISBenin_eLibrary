# 📚 Reading Verification & Tracking System

## Problem Statement
**Current Issue:** Simply returning a book doesn't prove the student actually read it. The leaderboard counts returned books, but students could game the system without reading.

## Solution: Multi-Layer Reading Verification System

---

## 🎯 Core System: Book Reports (Primary Method)

### How It Works:

1. **Student Borrows Book** → Reads it
2. **Before Returning** → Must submit a book report
3. **Librarian Reviews Report** → Approves/Rejects with quality score
4. **Points Awarded** → Student gets points based on:
   - Base Points: 10 points
   - Quality Bonus: 0-10 points (librarian's assessment)
   - Completion Bonus: 0-5 points (% of book completed)
   - **Total: 10-25 points per book**

### Book Report Requirements:

Students must provide:
- ✅ **Summary** (min 100 words) - What the book was about
- ✅ **Favorite Part** - What they liked most
- ✅ **Main Characters** - Who were the key people/characters
- ✅ **Lessons Learned** - What did they take away
- ✅ **Rating** (1-5 stars) - How much they liked it
- ✅ **Completion %** - Did they finish the book?

### Report Status Workflow:

```
[Student Submits] 
    ↓
[pending] → Librarian reviews
    ↓
    ├─→ [approved] → Points awarded → Leaderboard updated ✅
    ├─→ [revision_needed] → Student must improve and resubmit 🔄
    └─→ [rejected] → No points, must read another book ❌
```

## 🔐 Anti-Cheating Measures

2. **Generic Reports** - Identify vague, non-specific answers
3. **Time Checks** - Report submitted too quickly after borrowing
4. **Multiple Reports** - Same report for different books
5. **Reading Progress** - No progress tracked but report submitted

### Consequences:
- 1st offense: Revision required + warning
- 2nd offense: Report rejected, no points
- 3rd offense: Temporary suspension from borrowing
