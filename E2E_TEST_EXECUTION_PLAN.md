# COMPREHENSIVE END-TO-END TEST EXECUTION PLAN

## üìã Executive Summary

This document provides a complete, step-by-step plan to test the IISBenin eLibrary system as admin (iksotech@gmail.com / @ICTAdmin), identify all broken features, and apply fixes.

---

## üéØ Testing Objectives

1. **Verify database integrity** - All tables, columns, indexes, and RLS policies exist and work
2. **Test admin authentication** - Login, session persistence, permissions
3. **Test all CRUD operations** - Books, Students, Staff, Borrow Records
4. **Identify broken features** - Document everything that doesn't work
5. **Apply fixes** - Execute SQL and code fixes for all issues
6. **Re-test** - Confirm all features work after fixes

---

## üìù Pre-Test Setup

### Required Tools:
- ‚úÖ Supabase account access
- ‚úÖ SQL Editor access
- ‚úÖ Browser DevTools (F12)
- ‚úÖ Admin credentials: iksotech@gmail.com / @ICTAdmin

### Files Created for Testing:
1. `comprehensive-test.sql` - Database health check
2. `comprehensive-e2e-test.js` - Browser console test script
3. `APPLY_ALL_FIXES.sql` - Fix all identified issues
4. `COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_GUIDE.md` - Manual testing checklist
5. `ISSUES_AND_FIXES.md` - Detailed issue documentation

---

## üî¨ Phase 1: Database Health Check (10 minutes)

### Step 1.1: Run Comprehensive Database Test

1. **Login to Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Open new query**
4. **Copy entire contents** of `comprehensive-test.sql`
5. **Run the query**

### Step 1.2: Review Results

Check each section output:

#### ‚úÖ TABLE EXISTENCE CHECK
Expected: All tables show "‚úÖ EXISTS"
```
books          ‚úÖ EXISTS    [count]
students       ‚úÖ EXISTS    [count]
staff          ‚úÖ EXISTS    [count]
borrow_records ‚úÖ EXISTS    [count]
user_profiles  ‚úÖ EXISTS    [count]
```

**If any show "‚ùå MISSING":**
- Action: Run `APPLY_ALL_FIXES.sql` immediately
- Impact: Critical - app won't function

#### ‚úÖ ADMIN USER CHECK
Expected: At least 1 row for iksotech@gmail.com
```
id                  | email              | full_name      | role      | enrollment_id
--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------|--------------
[uuid]              | iksotech@gmail.com | IKS ICT Admin  | librarian | ADMIN001
```

**If no rows:**
- Action: Admin user doesn't exist - needs creation
- Impact: Critical - can't login

#### ‚úÖ RLS POLICIES CHECK
Expected: Policies for all tables
```
staff_select_all
staff_insert_librarian
staff_update_librarian
staff_delete_librarian
... (similar for other tables)
```

**If missing policies:**
- Action: Run `APPLY_ALL_FIXES.sql`
- Impact: High - RLS will block queries

#### ‚úÖ SAMPLE DATA
Review counts for:
- Students: [count]
- Staff: [count] ‚ö†Ô∏è If 0 but staff were created, this is the KNOWN BUG
- Books: [count]
- Borrow Records: [count]

#### ‚úÖ ORPHANED RECORDS CHECK
Expected: All counts = 0
```
Students without profiles: 0
Staff without profiles: 0
Student profiles without student records: 0
Staff profiles without staff records: 0
```

**If any > 0:**
- Action: Run `APPLY_ALL_FIXES.sql`
- Impact: Medium - affects data integrity

### Step 1.3: Document Issues Found

Create a list of issues from Phase 1:
```
[ ] Missing tables: _____________
[ ] Missing admin user
[ ] Missing RLS policies: _____________
[ ] Orphaned records: [count]
[ ] Staff count shows 0 despite records existing
```

### Step 2.2: Run Automated Test Script

1. **Copy entire contents** of `comprehensive-e2e-test.js`
2. **Paste into Console**
3. **Press Enter**
4. **Wait for test to complete** (~30 seconds)

### Step 2.3: Review Test Summary

The script outputs:
```
üìä TEST SUMMARY
========================================

‚úÖ PASSED: [X] tests
   ‚úÖ Authentication: User session active
   ‚úÖ User profile: librarian - IKS ICT Admin
   ‚úÖ Table books: accessible (X rows)
   ... etc

   ... etc

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNINGS: [X]
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Staff count is 0
   ... etc

Overall: [‚úÖ ALL TESTS PASSED | ‚ùå SOME TESTS FAILED]
```

### Step 2.4: Check Network Tab

1. **Go to Network tab** in DevTools
2. **Filter by:** `rest/v1`
3. **Look for:**
   - ‚ùå 404 errors (missing tables/resources)
   - ‚ùå 401/403 errors (RLS blocking)
   - ‚ùå 500 errors (server issues)

Common 404s to watch for:
