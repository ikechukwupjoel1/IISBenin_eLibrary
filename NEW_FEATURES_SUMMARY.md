**How it Works**:
```javascript
// Subscribes to messages table changes
supabase.channel('messages-changes')
  .on('INSERT', (payload) => {
    // Automatically adds new message to conversation
    // Updates unread counts
    // Refreshes conversation list
  })
```

**User Experience**:
- Send a message ‚Üí Recipient sees it immediately (no refresh needed)
- Receive a message ‚Üí Appears instantly in conversation
- Unread badge ‚Üí Updates in real-time
- Conversation list ‚Üí Auto-sorts by latest message

---

## üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE MIGRATION REQUIRED

### UPDATE_LOGIN_LOGS_TABLE.sql
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Run this SQL in Supabase before login tracking works

**What it does**:
- Adds `location` column (City, Country from IP)
- Adds `user_agent` column (Browser/Device info)
- Adds `ip_address` column (User's IP address)
- Adds `full_name` column (Display name)
- Creates performance indexes

**To Run**:
1. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `UPDATE_LOGIN_LOGS_TABLE.sql`
3. Click "Run"
4. You should see: "‚úÖ LOGIN_LOGS TABLE UPDATED SUCCESSFULLY!"

**Why it's needed**:
The login tracking code tries to insert these fields, but they don't exist in the database yet. This was causing silent failures where no login logs were being recorded.

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES FIXED

### Issue 1: Login logs not counting

**Solution**: Created `UPDATE_LOGIN_LOGS_TABLE.sql` migration
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed (migration pending)

### Issue 2: Chat messages require refresh
**Problem**: No real-time updates, users had to manually refresh
**Solution**: Added PostgreSQL Realtime subscriptions to ChatMessaging
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed and deployed

### Issue 3: Null reference error in chat
**Problem**: `user.full_name.toLowerCase()` failed when full_name was null
**Solution**: Changed to `user.full_name?.toLowerCase()` (optional chaining)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed and deployed
