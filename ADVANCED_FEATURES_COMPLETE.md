## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Data Queries:
- **Efficient date filtering** using PostgreSQL range queries
- **Aggregation logic** for statistics (client-side when needed)
- **Join queries** for user/book details
- **Sorted results** for optimal display

### Performance:
- **Lazy loading** of analytics data
- **Cached results** where appropriate
- **Limit queries** (500 recent logs)
- **Indexed lookups** on timestamps

### CSV Generation Algorithm:
```typescript
1. Query database with filters
2. Get related data (users, books)
3. Format data with proper escaping
4. Create CSV headers
5. Loop through records
6. Generate quoted CSV rows
7. Create Blob with UTF-8 encoding
8. Trigger browser download
```

### Device Detection Logic:
```typescript
// User-Agent string parsing:
- Check for tablet keywords
- Check for mobile keywords
- Default to desktop
- Extract browser name
- Extract OS name
```

### Location Parsing:
```typescript
// Expected format: "City, Country"
- Split by comma
- First part = City
- Last part = Country
- Handle missing data gracefully
```
