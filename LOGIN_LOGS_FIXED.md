# 🔧 Login Logs - NOW FIXED!

## ✅ What Was Wrong

The `logLogin` function was using incorrect field names:
- ❌ Was using: `success: true/false`
- ✅ Now using: `status: 'success'/'failed'`
- ❌ Was missing: `role` and `full_name` fields
- ✅ Now includes: Both `role` and `full_name` in every log

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. **Try Logging In**
Log out and log back in as:
- Librarian (with email/password)
- Student (with enrollment ID/password)
- Staff (with enrollment ID/password)

### 2. **Check Login Logs Tab**
1. Login as librarian
2. Go to **Login Logs** tab
3. Should now see login records with:
   - User name
   - Enrollment ID
   - Role (librarian/student/staff)
   - Login time
   - Status (Success/Failed)

### 3. **Verify Data in Database**
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT 
  full_name,
  enrollment_id,
  role,
  status,
  login_at
FROM login_logs 
ORDER BY login_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

Should see your recent login attempts!

## 🎯 What's Logged Now

Every login attempt records:
- ✅ `user_id` - UUID from user_profiles
- ✅ `enrollment_id` - LIB123, STU456, STF789, or email
- ✅ `full_name` - User's full name
- ✅ `role` - librarian/student/staff
- ✅ `status` - 'success' or 'failed'
- ✅ `login_at` - Timestamp
- ✅ `ip_address` - (optional)
- ✅ `user_agent` - (optional)

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### **Successful Login:**
```
Full Name: John Doe
Enrollment ID: STU12345678
Role: student
Status: Success
Login Time: 2025-10-22 14:30:45
```

### **Failed Login:**
```
Full Name: (may be blank if user not found)
Enrollment ID: STU12345678
Role: student
Status: Failed
Login Time: 2025-10-22 14:29:12
```

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Log out** from your current session
2. **Log back in** (this creates a log entry)
3. **Go to Login Logs tab** (should now show data!)
4. **Try multiple logins** with different accounts
5. **Verify filtering** by role works

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "No login logs found"?
1. Hard refresh page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for console messages: "Logging login attempt:", "Login log created successfully"
4. Check for any errors in red

### Console shows errors?
Share the error message - it will help identify the issue

### Database still shows 0 records?
1. Clear browser cache
2. Try incognito/private window
3. Log in fresh
4. Check database again
