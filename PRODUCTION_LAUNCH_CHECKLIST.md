```sql
-- Policy 1: Upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload attachments"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'message-attachments');

-- Policy 2: Read
CREATE POLICY "Users can read attachments"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'message-attachments');

ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'message-attachments');
```

## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

1. **Don't rush the database migrations** - Take time to verify they ran correctly
2. **Test thoroughly after each fix** - Don't accumulate untested changes
3. **Keep staging and production separate** - Test in dev first
4. **Document as you go** - Future you will thank you
5. **Have a rollback plan** - Know how to revert if something breaks

---

## 🆘 EMERGENCY CONTACTS

**If something breaks after launch:**

1. **Immediate Rollback:**
   ```bash
   vercel rollback
   ```

2. **Revert Code:**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Check Logs:**
   - Vercel Dashboard → Deployment → Functions → Logs
   - Supabase Dashboard → Logs
   - Browser Console (F12)

4. **Disable Feature:**
   - Can temporarily hide broken features via feature flags
   - Or disable specific routes in vercel.json
