## üìä Technical Details

### Recommendations Algorithm:
```typescript
// Collaborative Filtering:
1. Get user's borrowed books
2. Find other users who borrowed same books
3. Get books those users also borrowed
4. Rank by frequency (most co-borrowed first)
5. Exclude books user already borrowed

// Popularity Ranking:
1. Count all borrow_records per book_id
2. Sort books by borrow count DESC
3. Show top results

// Category-Based:
1. Analyze user's borrow history by category
2. Find most frequently borrowed categories
3. Suggest unread books from those categories
```

### Search Performance:
- Uses Supabase's `ilike` for case-insensitive search
- OR operator for multi-field search
- Client-side sorting for popularity/rating (requires aggregation)
- Server-side sorting for title/author/date (faster)

### PWA Architecture:
- **Cache Strategy**: Network-first, fallback to cache
- **Cache Versioning**: Automatic cleanup on updates
- **Install Prompt**: Browser handles automatically
- **Offline Fallback**: Shows cached content when offline

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Build Application:
```powershell
npm run build
```

### 2. Test PWA Locally:

### 4. Deploy to Vercel:
```powershell
vercel --prod --yes
```

### 5. Verify in Production:
