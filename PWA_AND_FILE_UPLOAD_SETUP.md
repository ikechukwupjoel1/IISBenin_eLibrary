## ‚ö†Ô∏è File Upload Setup - REQUIRES DATABASE ACTION

The file upload code is ready, but you need to **create the storage bucket** in Supabase:

### Step 1: Run SQL Script

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com
2. Select your project: **IISBenin_eLibrary**
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy and paste the contents of `CREATE_MESSAGE_ATTACHMENTS_BUCKET.sql`
6. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

### Step 2: Verify Storage Bucket

1. Go to **Storage** in Supabase Dashboard
2. You should see a bucket named `message-attachments`
3. Click on it to verify it exists

### Step 3: Test File Upload

1. Go to the app: https://iisbeninelibrary-2tv0gbp4z-joel-prince-a-ikechukwus-projects.vercel.app
2. Login and go to **Chat/Messaging**
3. Click the **paperclip icon** (üìé)
4. Select a file (max 10MB)
5. The file preview should show

## Alternative: Manual Storage Bucket Creation

If the SQL script doesn't work, create the bucket manually:

### Via Supabase Dashboard:

1. **Go to Storage**
2. **Click "New bucket"**
3. **Name:** `message-attachments`
4. **Public:** ‚úÖ Checked (files need to be publicly accessible)
5. **Click "Create bucket"**

### Set Policies:

1. **Click on the bucket**
2. **Go to "Policies" tab**
3. **Add these policies:**

**Policy 1: Allow Upload**
- **Policy name:** Allow authenticated users to upload
- **Allowed operation:** INSERT
- **Target roles:** authenticated
- **USING expression:** `bucket_id = 'message-attachments'`

**Policy 2: Allow Read**
- **Policy name:** Allow authenticated users to read
- **Allowed operation:** SELECT
- **Target roles:** authenticated
- **USING expression:** `bucket_id = 'message-attachments'`

**Policy 3: Allow Delete**
- **Policy name:** Allow users to delete their own files
- **Allowed operation:** DELETE
- **Target roles:** authenticated
- **USING expression:** 
```sql
bucket_id = 'message-attachments' AND
