## ‚ö†Ô∏è Login Logs Issue

### **Status:** Still Not Working

### **Why:**
The `login_logs` table needs to be created with proper structure.

### **Solution:**
Run `COMPLETE_DATABASE_SETUP.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### **Quick Test:**
Run `test_login_logs.sql` to check if table exists:
```sql
-- This will show if table exists and has data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM login_logs;
```

If error "relation login_logs does not exist", then run the complete setup script.
