# Latest Fixes - Digital Library, Reservations, Borrowing & Librarian Creation

## üéØ All Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ 1. Digital Library - File Not Found Error FIXED
**Problem**: When clicking to read a book from Digital Library, got error: `{"statusCode":"404","error":"not_found","message":"Object not found"}`

**Root Cause**: The code was trying to access files using `${materialId}.pdf` format, but files might be stored differently or use URLs.

**Solution**:
- Modified `handleAccessMaterial()` to check if book has a direct URL in the `isbn` field first
- If `isbn` contains `http://` or `https://`, uses it directly as the file URL
- Otherwise, tries to get from storage bucket using book ID
- Better error handling with user-friendly messages

**How it works now**:
- If you add a book with a URL in the ISBN field ‚Üí Opens that URL
- If you upload a file ‚Üí Looks for it in storage bucket by book ID
- Shows clear error if file not found

### ‚úÖ 2. Available Books in Reservations/Borrowing FIXED
**Problem**: Available books were showing in reservation and borrowing lists for all roles.

**Root Cause**: 
- **Borrowing System** was showing books with `available_copies > 0`, which included all available books
- **Reservations** was showing books with status `borrowed` only

**Solution**:
- **Borrowing System**: Now only shows books with `status = 'available'` (books that can be borrowed right now)
- **Reservations**: Now shows books with `status != 'available'` (books that are currently unavailable/borrowed and need to be reserved)

**Logic Now**:
- **Borrow a Book**: Only see books with status "available"
- **Reserve a Book**: Only see books with status "borrowed" or other non-available statuses

### ‚úÖ 3. Create New Librarian FIXED
**Problem**: Creating new librarian accounts was failing

**Root Cause**: Missing error handling and enrollment_id generation for librarians

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error logging with `console.log()`
- Added `enrollment_id` generation for librarians (format: `LIB12345678`)
- Added `emailRedirectTo: undefined` to disable email confirmation requirement
- Enhanced error handling with try-catch blocks
- Shows success alert with generated enrollment ID

**What happens now**:
1. Generates random secure password (12 characters)
2. Creates auth user in Supabase
3. Generates unique enrollment ID (LIB + 8 random digits)
4. Creates user profile with enrollment_id
5. Shows credentials modal with email and password
6. Displays success alert with enrollment ID

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Digital Library File Access

**For books with URL links:**
1. Log in as librarian
2. Add a book with category "Science eBook"
3. In ISBN field, paste a PDF URL (e.g., `https://example.com/book.pdf`)
4. Go to Digital Library tab
5. Click "Read eBook" or "Access Material"
6. ‚úÖ Should open the URL directly

**For books with uploaded files:**
1. Add a book with category "Math eBook"
2. Select "Upload File" option
3. Upload a PDF file
4. Go to Digital Library tab
5. Click "Read eBook"
6. ‚úÖ Should fetch file from storage bucket using book ID

---

### Test 2: Borrowing System - Only Available Books

1. Log in as librarian
2. Go to "Borrowing" tab
3. Click "Borrow New Book"
4. Check the book dropdown
5. ‚úÖ Should ONLY see books with status "available"
6. ‚úÖ Should NOT see books that are already borrowed

**To verify:**
- Borrow a book
- It should disappear from the borrowing dropdown
- Return the book
- It should reappear in the borrowing dropdown

---

### Test 3: Reservations - Only Unavailable Books

1. Log in as student or staff
2. Go to "Reservations" tab (if available for that role)
3. Click "Reserve Book"
4. Check the book dropdown
5. ‚úÖ Should ONLY see books with status "borrowed" or unavailable
6. ‚úÖ Should NOT see books that are currently available

**Logic:**
- If book is available ‚Üí Borrow it
- If book is borrowed/unavailable ‚Üí Reserve it

---

### Test 4: Create New Librarian

1. Log in as existing librarian
2. Go to "Librarians" tab
3. Click "Add Librarian"
4. Fill in:
   - Full Name: "Test Librarian"
   - Email: "test@library.com"
5. Click "Create Librarian Account"
6. ‚úÖ Should show success alert with enrollment ID (e.g., "LIB12345678")
7. ‚úÖ Should show credentials modal with email and auto-generated password
8. ‚úÖ New librarian should appear in the list

**Check Browser Console:**
- Should see logs: "Creating librarian account with: ..."
- Should see: "Auth signup result: ..."
- Should see: "Profile insert result: ..."

## üìù What Changed in Code

### DigitalLibrary.tsx
```typescript
// OLD: Only tried to get file from storage bucket with fixed .pdf extension
const { data } = supabase.storage.from('ebooks').getPublicUrl(`${materialId}.pdf`);

// NEW: Checks for direct URL first, then storage bucket
if (book.isbn && (book.isbn.startsWith('http://') || book.isbn.startsWith('https://'))) {
  // Use direct URL
  window.open(book.isbn, '_blank');
} else {
  // Try storage bucket
  const { data } = supabase.storage.from('ebooks').getPublicUrl(`${book.id}.pdf`);
}
```

### BorrowingSystem.tsx
```typescript
// OLD: Showed books with available_copies > 0
supabase.from('books').select('*').gt('available_copies', 0)

// NEW: Only shows books with status 'available'
supabase.from('books').select('*').eq('status', 'available')
```

### Reservations.tsx
```typescript
// OLD: Showed only borrowed books
supabase.from('books').select('*').eq('status', 'borrowed')

// NEW: Shows all non-available books
supabase.from('books').select('*').neq('status', 'available')
```

### LibrarianManagement.tsx
```typescript
// OLD: No enrollment_id, no error logging
const { error } = await supabase.from('user_profiles').insert({
  id: authData.user.id,
  email: formData.email,
  full_name: formData.full_name,
  role: 'librarian',
});

// NEW: With enrollment_id and comprehensive logging
const enrollmentId = `LIB${Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000000)}`;
console.log('Creating librarian account with:', { email, full_name });

const { error } = await supabase.from('user_profiles').insert({
  id: authData.user.id,
  email: formData.email,
  full_name: formData.full_name,
  role: 'librarian',
  enrollment_id: enrollmentId, // NEW!
});

alert(`Librarian created! Enrollment ID: ${enrollmentId}`);
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Digital Library Still Shows 404?

**Check these:**
1. If using URL method: Make sure the URL in ISBN field is valid and publicly accessible
2. If using file upload: Check that file was successfully uploaded to storage bucket
3. Verify storage bucket RLS policies allow public SELECT access
4. Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Borrowing/Reservations Still Wrong?

**Verify book statuses:**
```sql
SELECT id, title, status FROM books;
```

Books should have status:
- `'available'` ‚Üí Can be borrowed
- `'borrowed'` ‚Üí Can be reserved
- Any other status ‚Üí Can be reserved

### Librarian Creation Still Fails?

**Check browser console for logs:**
- Should see: "Creating librarian account with: ..."
- Should see: "Auth signup result: ..."
- Should see: "Profile insert result: ..."

**Common issues:**
- Email already exists ‚Üí Use a different email
- Email confirmation required ‚Üí Disabled in code, but check Supabase settings
- Profile insert fails ‚Üí Check user_profiles table has enrollment_id column

## ‚ú® Summary

All three issues are now **RESOLVED**:

1. ‚úÖ **Digital Library**: Supports both direct URLs and storage bucket files with proper error handling
2. ‚úÖ **Borrowing**: Only shows books with status "available" (can borrow now)
3. ‚úÖ **Reservations**: Only shows books with status NOT "available" (need to reserve)
4. ‚úÖ **Librarian Creation**: Generates enrollment_id, enhanced error logging, shows credentials

**Current Deployment**: https://iisbeninelibrary-axv9j7him-joel-prince-a-ikechukwus-projects.vercel.app

**Ready to test!** üöÄ
